Ge - Variation - 4.txt,"Formerly men were unacquainted with fire and dried their meat by laying it out in the sun on a flat stone, so that it was not completely raw. In those days a man once took his young brother-in-law on an expedition to rob macaws' nests in a cleft of a vertical cliff. But the fledglings made such an outcry that the boy did not dare take hold of them. The man grew angry, knocked down the ladder, and went off. The Hero remained sitting by the nest, suffering from thirst, his head covered with birds' droppings, ""so that maggots grew there; and the young birds soon lost all fear of him."" The Jaguar's Wife was pregnant and could not bear the slightest noise; she therefore flew into a rage whenever the Hero made a noise as he chewed the grilled meat Jaguar had given him. But try as he might, Hero could not eat silently, since the meat was too crisp. With the weapons given him by the Jaguar, he wounded the Wife in the paw and fled. The Wife, hampered by her pregnancy, was unable to follow Hero. The Hero recounted his adventure to his father, who summoned all his companions. They placed runners at intervals all the way to the Jaguar's house and organized a relay system: the burning log was passed from hand to hand and finally reached the village. The Jaguar's Wife begged them in vain to leave her a burning ember; the toad spat on all those that remained, and put them out.",4,Fire
Ge - Variation - 6.txt,"One day a man went into the woods with his little brother-in-law in order to take young macaws out of a nest in the hollow of a tree. The man made his brother-in-law climb a pole; but when he got up there, the young Hero declared that there were only eggs there. When the man said he knew there were young in the nest, the Hero took a white stone in his mouth and threw it down. The stone turned into an egg that was smashed against the ground. The man was angry, pulled away the ladder, and went home, leaving the Hero in the tree where he was forced to remain for five days. Then a Jaguar passed by and asked what he was doing up there, made him first throw down the two young macaws (which were in fact in the nest), told Hero to jump after them, and, growling, caught the Hero between his front paws. Then the Hero was very much afraid, but nothing happened to him. The Jaguar carried the Hero on his shoulders until they came to a creek. Although the Hero was suffering greatly from thirst, he was not allowed to drink, because, as the Jaguar explained, the water belonged to the camon vulture (urubu). The same thing happened at the second creek, because the water there belonged to ""the little birds."" Finally, at the third creek, the Hero drank so much as to drain the whole creek, in spite of the entreaties of the alligator, the owner of the creek. The Hero was given a chilly welcome by the Jaguar's Wife, who reproached her husband for having brought back ""a lean and ugly boy."" She called the Hero to delouse her, but when she had Hero between her paws, she frightened Hero with her growls. He complained to the Jaguar, who made him a bow and arrows and ornaments, gave him two basketfuls of roast meat, and helped Hero back to his village, after advising him to aim for the Wife's carotid, should she try to pursue him. Everything happened as had been foreseen, and the Wife was killed. Shortly afterward the Hero heard people coming. It was his two brothers, to whom Hero revealed his identity, and who ran home to tell their mother. ""You lie,"" said their mother. ""He's been dead long since."" But the Hero concealed himself again. He came out of hiding on the occasion of the Aikman funeral festival. Everybody was amazed when they saw the roast meat Hero had brought back. ""Why, how is it roasted?"" ""In the sunshine,"" the Hero kept repeating, although Hero finally revealed the truth to his uncle. An expedition was organized to capture fire from the Jaguar. The mutum and the water fowl, both good runners, seized the trunk, but the jacu, following them, picked up the scattered embers.",4,Fire
Ge - Variation - 1.txt,"Noticing that a pair of macaws had built their nest on top of a steep rock, a Indian took his young brother-in-law, Botoque, with him to help him to capture the nestlings. He made Botoque climb up an improvised ladder; but when the Botoque got up to the nest, he said that he could find only two eggs. (It is not clear whether he was lying or telling the truth.) His brother-in-law insisted that Botoque should take them; but as the eggs fell down, they changed into stones which hurt the older man's hand. This made him furious, with the result that he dismantled the ladder and went away, not realizing that the birds were enchanted (oaianga) (?). Botoque remained caught on top of the rock for several days. He grew thin: hunger and thirst obliged him to eat his own excrement. Eventually Botoque noticed a spotted Jaguar carrying a bow and arrow and all kinds of game. Botoque would have liked to call out to it for help, but fear kept Botoque silent. The Jaguar saw the Botoque's shadow on the ground and, after trying in vain to catch it, looked up, asked what had happened, repaired the ladder, and invited Botoque to come down. The Botoque was afraid and hesitated a long time; in the end Botoque made up his mind, and the Jaguar, in friendly fashion, suggested that if Botoque would sit astride its back, it would take him to its home to have a meal of grilled meat. But the Botoque did not understand the meaning of the word ""grilled"" because in those days, the Indians were unacquainted with fire and ate their meat raw. At the Jaguar's home the Botoque saw a big jatoba trunk burning; beside it was a pile of stones such as the Indians now use to build their earth ovens. He ate his first meal of cooked meat. But the Jaguar's Wife, who was a Indian, disliked the young man and referred to him as me-on\ra-tum ""foreign, or abandoned, son""; in spite of this, the Jaguar, being childless, decided to adopt him. Each day the Jaguar went off to hunt, leaving the adopted Botoque with the Wife whose aversion for him steadily increased; she gave him only old wizened pieces of meat to eat, and leaves. When the Botoque complained, she scratched his face, and the poor Botoque had to take refuge in the forest. The Jaguar scolded the Wife, but in vain. One day it gave Botoque a brand new bow and some arrows, taught Botoque how to use them, and advised Botoque to use them against the Wife, should the need arise. Botoque killed Wife by shooting an arrow into her breast. Botoque fled in terror, taking with Botoque the weapons and a piece of grilled meat. Botoque reached his village in the middle of the night, groped his way to his mother's bed, and had some difficulty in making his identity known (because he was thought to be dead); Botoque told his tale and shared the meat. The Indians decided to get possession of the fire. When they arrived at the Jaguar's home, there was no one there; and since the Wife was dead, the game caught the day before had not been cooked. The Indians roasted it and took away the fire. For the very first time it was possible to have light in the village at night, to eat cooked meat, and to warm oneself at a hearth. But the Jaguar, incensed by the ingratitude of his adopted son, who had stolen ""fire and the secret of the bow and arrow,"" was to remain full of hatred for all living creatures, especially human beings. Now only the reflection of fire could be seen in its eyes. It used its fangs for hunting and ate its meat raw, having solemnly renounced grilled meat.",4,Fire
Ge - Variation - 2.txt,"Formerly, men did not know how to make fire. When they killed game, they cut the flesh into thin strips, which they laid out on stones to dry in the sun. They also ate rotten wood. One day a man noticed two macaws coming out of a hole in a cliff. To get at their nest, he made his young brother-in-law (his Wife's brother) climb a tree trunk in which he had cut foot holds. But there were nothing but round stones in the nest. An argument ensued, degenerating into a quarrel. The Hero, annoyed by his brother-in-law's taunts, threw the stones deliberately and wounded him. In response to his Wife's anxious inquiries, the man said the boy must have got lost, and to allay suspicion, he pretended to go and look for him. Meanwhile, suffering extreme hunger and thirst, the Hero was reduced to eating his excrement and drinking his urine. Hero was nothing but skin and bone when a Jaguar came along carrying a caititu pig on his shoulders; the animal noticed the Hero's shadow and tried to catch it. On each occasion the Hero moved back and the shadow disappeared. ""The Jaguar looked all round, then covering its mouth, looked up and saw the Hero on the rock."" They entered into conversation. The Hero was too frightened to sit directly on the Jaguar but agreed to bestride the caititu, which the latter was carrying on his back. They reached the Jaguar's home, where his Wife was busy spinning. Wife reproached her husband, saying ""you have brought home another's son."" Unperturbed, the Jaguar announced that he was going to adopt the Hero as his companion, and intended to feed him and fatten him up. But the Jaguar's Wife refused to give the Hero any tapir meat and allowed Hero only venison and threatened to scratch Hero at the slightest opportunity. Acting on the Jaguar's advice, the Hero killed the woman with the bow and arrow given him by his protector. Hero went off with the Jaguar's belongings: the spun cotton, the meat, and the burning ash. When Hero reached his village, Hero made himself known first to his sister, then to his mother. Hero was summoned to the ngobe ""men's house,"" where he related his adventures. The Indians decided to change themselves into animals to take possession of the fire: the tapir would carry the trunk, the yao bird would put out the burning ash that might be dropped on the way, while the deer would take charge of the meat, and the peccary of the spun cotton. The expedition was a success, and the men shared the fire between them.",4,Fire
Ge - Variation - 3.txt,"A man found a macaw's nest with two young birds in a high and vertical cliff. He took his little brother-in-law along, chopped down a tree, leaned it against the wall of rock, and bade the Hero climb. The Hero went up, but the parent birds rushed at him with fierce screams; so Hero got frightened. Then the man got angry, knocked the tree aside, and left. The Hero, unable to descend, remained sitting by the nest for five days. Hero nearly died of thirst and hunger. Hero was completely covered by the droppings of the macaws and swallows that flew above him. Then a Jaguar came past, saw the Hero's shadow, and tried in vain to catch it. Then the Hero spat down, and now the Jaguar raised his head and saw him. They entered into conversation. The Jaguar demanded to have the two young macaws, which the Hero flung down to him one after the other, and which he immediately devoured. Then the Jaguar brought up the tree and asked the Hero to step down, promising him that he would not eat Hero, and that he would give Hero water to quench his thirst. Somewhat hesitantly, the Hero complied. The Jaguar took Hero on his back and carried Hero to a creek. The Hero drank his fill and fell asleep. At last the Jaguar pinched his arm and awakened Hero. Hero washed the dirt off him and said that, having no children, Jaguar would take Hero home as his son. In the Jaguar's home a huge jatoba trunk was lying on the floor and burning at one end. In those days the Indians were unacquainted with fire and ate only flesh dried in the sun. ""What is smoking there?"" asked the Hero. ""That is fire,"" answered the Jaguar. ""You will find out at night when it warms you."" Then Jaguar gave the roast meat to the Hero, who ate till Hero fell asleep. At midnight Hero woke up, ate again, and then again fell asleep. Before daybreak the Jaguar went hunting. The Hero climbed a tree to await his return. But toward noon he got hungry, returned to the Jaguar's house, and begged his Wife for food. ""What!"" she shouted, baring her teeth. ""Look here!"" The Hero cried out from fear and ran to meet the Jaguar and told him of the occurrence. The Jaguar scolded his Wife, who excused herself, saying that she was merely jesting. But the same scene occurred again the next day. Following the advice of the Jaguar (who had made him a bow and arrow and told him to shoot at a termite's nest), the Hero killed the aggressive Wife. His adopted father said, ""That does not matter,"" gave him a lot of roast meat, and explained to Hero how to return to his village by following along the creek. But Hero was to be on guard: if a rock or the aroeira tree called him, he should answer; but was to keep still if he heard ""the gentle call of a rotten tree."" The Hero moved along the brook, replied to the first two calls and, forgetting the Jaguar's warnings, to the third as well. That is why men are short-lived: if the boy had answered only the first two, they would enjoy as long life as the rock and the aroeira tree. After a while the Hero again heard a call and replied to it. It was Magalon kamdure, an ogre, who tried unsuccessfully to pass himself off as the Hero's father by means of various disguises (long hair, ear ornaments). When the Hero finally discovered the ogre's identity, the latter wrestled with him until he was quite worn out, whereupon he put the Hero in his big carrying basket. On his way home the ogre stopped to hunt coatis. Speaking from inside the basket, the Hero called to him to make a trail through the woods first, so he could carry the load better. While the ogre was doing this, the Hero escaped, after weighting the basket with a heavy stone. When the ogre reached home, he promised his children a choice morsel, even better than the coatis. But all he found in the bottom of the basket was a stone. Meanwhile the Hero had found his way back to his village, where he related his adventures. All the Indians set off to look for the fire. Various animals offered their help: the jao was to extinguish the fallen embers; the jacu was spurned, but the tapir was considered strong enough to carry the tree. The Jaguar gave them the fire. ""I have adopted your son,"" he said to the boy's father.",4,Fire
Ge - Variation - 5.txt,"The two civilizing Heroes, Pud and Pudlere, formerly lived with men and put fire at their disposal. But when the Heroes went away, they took the fire with them, and men were reduced to eating their meat raw, sun-dried, and accompanied by pau puba. It was during this period that the brothers-in-law undertook their expedition. The younger of the two men was abandoned on the cliff face, where he wept among the angry birds: ""After two days the birds became used to him. The macaw deposited its droppings on his head, which swarmed with vermin. He was hungry."" Jaguar saw Hero. Jaguar adopted Hero. The Jaguar's Wife was pregnant and liked to frighten the boy by threatening to eat him. The Jaguar showed the Hero the secret of the bow and arrows; and, following his advice, the Hero wounded the Wife in the paw and ran away.

Mataco - Woman.txt,"Once upon a time, Men were animals who could speak. Men had no Women, and Men lived on fish which Men caught in great quantities. One day Men noticed that their supplies of food had been stolen, so Men left a parrot on guard. The bird, from its perch at the top of a tree, saw Women coming down from the sky by the means of a rope. Women ate as much as they could and went to sleep in the shade of the tree. Instead of giving the alarm as he had been instructed to do, the parrot began to throw pieces of wood at the Women, who woke up and discovered him. Women bombarded Parrot with seeds, one of which hit the bird's tongue, which has been black ever since. The iguana heard the sound of the fight and informed his companions; but believing him to be deaf, they refused to pay any attention. The parrot meanwhile had been struck dumb. The next day the lizard mounted guard, but the Women captured him and tore out his tongue, so that he, too, was struck dumb. The Men, after a discussion, entrusted the village to the care of the hawk, which could not be seen by the Women because the color of its plumage was indistinguishable from that of the trunk of the tree in which it was perched. The hawk gave the alarm; although the Women threw things at him, he nevertheless managed to cut the rope. Henceforth the Men were provided with Women.",9,Woman
Toba-Pilaga - Woman.txt,"Formerly Men used to hunt and store their supply of game on the thatched roofs of their huts. One day, in Men's absence, a group of Women came down from the sky and stole all the meat. The same thing happened the next day, and the Men, who did not know that Women existed, set Rabbit to watch. But Rabbit slept all the time, and the grilled meat was stolen. The next day Parrot stood guard, hidden in a quebracho tree, and he saw the Women, who had toothed vaginas. After remaining quiet and motionless at first, Parrot threw a fruit down from the tree onto the Women who were feasting below. The Women began by accusing each other; then they discovered Parrot and began to fight about whose husband he should be. Women threw things at each other, and one of the sticks went astray and broke the bone under the parrot's tongue. Being now struck dumb and compelled to express himself through gestures, Parrot could not make the Men understand what had happened. It was now Hawk's turn to mount guard, and Hawk took care to arm himself with two throwing sticks. The first missed its target and enabled the Women to discover him; but although Women fought with each other about who should have him as husband and then tried in vain to kill him by throwing things at him, with his second stick Hawk succeeded in cutting one of the two ropes used by the Women to travel up and down from the sky (one rope was for pretty Women with fair complexions, the other for old, ugly ones). Several Women fell down and sank into the earth, but not before Hawk had captured two Women for his own use. Hawk then called to his Men. Only Iguana could hear him, but since Iguana had very small ears, the other Men refused to admit that his hearing could be keener than theirs. Eventually Hawk managed to make himself audible to Men. . . . Armadillo extracted the Women from the earth and distributed them among Men.",9,Woman
