  "myth_text": "A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen. The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, turning round, thus addressed the wheels: \"Hullo there! why do you make so much noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out.\" Those who suffer most cry out the least.\""
