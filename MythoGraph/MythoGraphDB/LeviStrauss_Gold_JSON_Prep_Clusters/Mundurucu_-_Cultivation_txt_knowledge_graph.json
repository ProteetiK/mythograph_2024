  "myth_text": "Formerly there were neither gardens nor cultivated plants. An old woman was pestered by her young nephew, who was hungry and was asking for agricultural produce which did not yet exist. She had a section of the forest cleared and burned and informed men of all that would grow there: maize, sweet potatoes, sugar canes, bananas, sweet manioc, cara, melons, cashew nuts, inga pods, fava and feijao. . . . And she explained when each plant should be harvested, and how it should be cooked and flavored. But she also explained that timbo (fish poison) was poisonous and should not be eaten. Men should pull it up, grind it in water, and invite everybody to share the dead fish which, unlike the timbo, could be eaten. he had herself buried in the garden, and from her body sprang all of the plants."
