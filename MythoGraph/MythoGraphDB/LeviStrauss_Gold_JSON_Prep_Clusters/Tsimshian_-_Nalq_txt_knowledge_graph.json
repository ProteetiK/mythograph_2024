  "myth_text": "In early times young people used to meet in the evening behind the houses. They used to amuse themselves by playing noisy games far into the night. The sky was irritated by the din and sent down a beautiful magic plume, which a young man tried to catch as it fell. But as soon as he caught it, he was carried off into the air; then in a long chain all the others were, too, since each one attempted to hold back the one in front by hanging on to his or her feet. All the people were taken up by the plume; and at last they fell, and all died. Not one of them survived. However, one young woman had remained indoors, because she had been in labor. She gave birth to a series of miraculous children. After telling them of the fate that had befallen their family, she warned them against playing outdoors. But they provoked the sky into sending down the plume again, and succeeded in catching it. Using it as a talisman, they embarked on a journey around the world, reached the city of the Air, and finally married the daughters of the winds of the four cardinal points; they settled how and when these winds should blow."
