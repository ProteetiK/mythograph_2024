  "myth_text": "After the Fire he refused to give to Men had been stolen from him by a Toad, the Demiurge married a young Indian. Yielding to his father-in-law's entreaties, Demiurge agreed to ask the king-Vulture for the celestial lights\u2014the stars, the sun, and the moon, which were essential for lighting the Earth. The Demiurge then asked the Vulture to teach Men the arts of civilization, using himself, the Demiurge, as an intermediary. After which the Vulture, whom the Demiurge had lured down by feigning Death, flew off. At that moment the Demiurge's mother-in-law was prompted to ask the Vulture how old Men could be rejuvenated. The reply came from very high up and very far away. The trees and certain animals could hear it, but not Men."
