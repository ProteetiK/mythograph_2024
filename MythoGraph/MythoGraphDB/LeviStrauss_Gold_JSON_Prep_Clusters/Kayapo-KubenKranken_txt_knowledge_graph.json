  "myth_text": "While camping on the outskirts of a village with his son, the culture hero O'oimbre sent the boy to ask for food from his mother's relatives. The boy was badly received, and as a revenge, O'oimbre made a charm with feathers and thorns and used it to change all the villagers into peccaries. They remained shut up in their huts as if they were pigsties; Takake, the brother-in-law and rival of O'oimbre, drew one of them out (by the means described in the preceding myth) and killed it. O'oimbre forced a confession from Takake's son, went to the pigsty and set the peccaries free."
