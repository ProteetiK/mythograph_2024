  "myth_text": "In the beginning there were no Women, and Men practiced homosexuality. One of them became pregnant but was unable to give birth, and died. Once several Men, reaching a spring, saw in it the reflection of a Woman who was sitting high up in the branches of a tree. For two days they tried to catch the reflection. At last one of them looked up and spied the Woman; they brought Woman down, but since each wanted to have Woman, they cut Woman into little pieces which were shared out. Each Man wrapped his piece in a leaf and put the bundle in the grass wall of his hut. Then all Men went hunting. On their way back they sent ahead a Messenger who discovered that the pieces had all changed into Women. The puma, who had been given a piece from the chest, found himself with a very pretty Woman; the semema, who had twisted his slice too tight, found himself with a very lean Woman. But each Man now had a Woman; and when Men went hunting, they took their Women along."
