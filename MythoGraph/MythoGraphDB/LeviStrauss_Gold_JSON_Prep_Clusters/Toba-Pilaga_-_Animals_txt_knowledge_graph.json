  "myth_text": "The demiurge Nedamik subjected the first humans to an ordeal by tickling. Humans who laughed were changed into land or water animals: the Humans that didn't laugh were preyed upon by the jaguar; the Humans that didn't laugh were able to escape from Nedamik by taking refuge in the water. Those humans who maintained self-control became jaguars or men who hunted jaguars and got the better of Humans who laughed."
