  "myth_text": "There was a Woman who was a sorceress. She defiled caraguata plants with menstrual blood. Woman served caraguata plants to her Man as food. The Man, having been told about this by his Son, announced that he was going to look for honey. After knocking the soles of his leather sandals together \"to find honey more easily,\" Man discovered a hive at the bottom of a tree and a snake. Man kept the pure honey for his Son, and for his Woman prepared a mixture composed of honey and the flesh of snake embryos taken from the belly of the one Man had killed. No sooner had the Woman begun to eat her portion than her body started to itch. As Woman scratched herself, she announced to her Man that Woman was about to devour Man. Man ran away and climbed to the top of a tree where there was a parrot's nest. He kept the Woman quiet temporarily by throwing to Woman the three nestlings, one after the other. While Woman was chasing the largest which was trying to flutter away from Woman, the Man ran off in the direction of a pit that he himself had dug for the purpose of catching game. Man avoided the pit, but the Woman fell into it and was killed. The Man filled in the hole and kept watch over it. An unknown plant eventually sprouted there. Out of curiosity the Man dried the leaves in the sun; at nightfall he smoked in great secret. Man's companions caught him at it and asked what he was doing. Thus it was that men came to have tobacco."
