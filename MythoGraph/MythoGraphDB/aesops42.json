  "myth_text": "A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. \"And you,\" they said, \"how many sons have you at a birth?\" The Lioness laughed at them, and said: \"Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred Lion.\" The value is in the worth, not in the number."
