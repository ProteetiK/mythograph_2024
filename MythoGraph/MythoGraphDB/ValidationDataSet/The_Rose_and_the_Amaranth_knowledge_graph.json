I\n      envy you your beauty and your perfume.\" The Rose replied, \"I indeed, dear\n      Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season! If no cruel hand pluck me from\n      my stem, yet I must perish by an early doom. But thou art immortal and\n      dost never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed youth.\""
