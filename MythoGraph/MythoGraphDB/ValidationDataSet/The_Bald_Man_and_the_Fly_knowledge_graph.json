  "myth_text": "A FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy it, gave\n      himself a heavy slap. Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, \"You who have\n      wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect, see what\n      you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?\" The Bald Man replied,\n      \"I can easily make peace with myself, because I know there was no\n      intention to hurt. But you, an ill-favored and contemptible insect who\n      delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have killed you even\n      if I had incurred a heavier penalty.\""
