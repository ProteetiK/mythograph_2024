  "myth_text": "A BOY was stung by a Nettle. He ran home and told his Mother, saying, \"Although it hurts me very much, I only touched it gently.\" \"That was just why it stung you,\" said his Mother. \"The next time you touch a Nettle, grasp it boldly, and it will be soft as silk to your hand, and not in the least hurt you.\" Whatever you do, do with all your might."
