  "myth_text": "There lived in a certain place a Brahman whose name was Svabhavakripana which means \"a born miser.\" He had collected a quantity of rice by begging and after having dined off it he filled a pot with what was left over. He hung the pot on a peg on the wall placed his couch beneath and looking intently at it all the night he thought \"Ah that pot is indeed brimful of rice. Now if there should be a famine I should certainly make a hundred rupees by it. With this I shall buy a couple of goats. They will have young ones every six months and thus I shall have a whole herd of goats. Then with the goats I shall buy cows. As soon as they have calved I shall sell the calves. Then with the calves I shall buy buffaloes; with the buffaloes mares. When the mares have foaled I shall have plenty of horses; and when I sell them plenty of gold. With that gold I shall get a house with four wings. And then a Brahman will come to my house and will give me his beautiful daughter with a large dowry. She will have a son and I shall call him Somasarman. When he is old enough to be danced on his father's knee I shall sit with a book at the back of the stable and while I am reading the boy will see me jump from his mother's lap and run towards me to be danced on my knee. He will come too near the horse's hoof and full of anger I shall call to my wife 'Take the baby; take him!' But she distracted by some domestic work does not hear me. Then I get up and give her such a kick with my foot.\" While he thought this he gave a kick with his foot and broke the pot. All the rice fell over him and made him quite white. Therefore I say \"He who makes foolish plans for the future will be white all over like the father of Somasarman.\""
