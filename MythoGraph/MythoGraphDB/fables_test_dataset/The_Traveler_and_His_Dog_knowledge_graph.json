  "myth_text": "A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door\n      stretching himself. He asked him sharply: Why do you stand there gaping?\n      Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly. The Dog, wagging\n      his tail, replied: O, master! I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am\n      waiting. The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend."
