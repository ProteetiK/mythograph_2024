  "myth_text": "A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He whistled\n      and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention to the\n      summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its horn, begged\n      the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied, Why, you silly fellow,\n      the horn will speak though I be silent. Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid."
