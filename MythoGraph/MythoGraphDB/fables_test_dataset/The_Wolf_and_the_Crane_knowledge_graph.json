When the Crane had\n      extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the Wolf, grinning\n      and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: Why, you have surely already had a\n      sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw out your head in\n      safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf. In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape\n      injury for your pains."
