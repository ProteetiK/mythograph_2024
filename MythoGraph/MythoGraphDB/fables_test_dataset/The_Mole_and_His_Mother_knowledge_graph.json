  "myth_text": "A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: I am sure\n      than I can see, Mother! In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his\n      Mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, What is\n      it? The young Mole said, It is a pebble. His Mother exclaimed: My son,\n      I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that you have lost your sense\n      of smell."
