  "myth_text": "THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected in the\n      summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly\n      begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, Why did you not\n      treasure up food during the summer? He replied, I had not leisure\n      enough. I passed the days in singing. They then said in derision: If you\n      were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to\n      bed in the winter."
