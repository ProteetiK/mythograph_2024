  "myth_text": "A SICK STAG lay down in a quiet corner of its pasture-ground. His\n      companions came in great numbers to inquire after his health, and each one\n      helped himself to a share of the food which had been placed for his use;\n      so that he died, not from his sickness, but from the failure of the means\n      of living. Evil companions bring more hurt than profit."
