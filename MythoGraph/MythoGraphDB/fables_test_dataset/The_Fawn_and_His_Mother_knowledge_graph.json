  "myth_text": "A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, You are larger than a dog, and\n      swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense;\n      why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so? She smiled, and said:\n      I know full well, my son, that all you say is true. I have the advantages\n      you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a single dog I feel ready to\n      faint, and fly away as fast as I can. No arguments will give courage to the coward."
