  "myth_text": "A CONTROVERSY prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the\n      animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of\n      whelps at a birth. They rushed clamorously into the presence of the\n      Lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute. And you, they\n      said, how many sons have you at a birth? The Lioness laughed at them,\n      and said: Why! I have only one; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred\n      Lion. The value is in the worth, not in the number."
