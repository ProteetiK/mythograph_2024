  "myth_text": "A DOG used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met, and to bite\n      them without notice. His master suspended a bell about his neck so that\n      the Dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went. Thinking it a\n      mark of distinction, the Dog grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it\n      all over the marketplace. One day an old hound said to him: Why do you\n      make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell that you carry is not,\n      believe me, any order of merit, but on the contrary a mark of disgrace, a\n      public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill mannered dog. Notoriety is often mistaken for fame."
