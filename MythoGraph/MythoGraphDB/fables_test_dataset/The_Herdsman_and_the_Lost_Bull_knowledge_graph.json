  "myth_text": "A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold.\n      After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only\n      discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in\n      sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest. Not long\n      afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a Lion\n      feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and his\n      hands to heaven, and said: Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the\n      Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed me;\n      but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a\n      full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own\n      escape from him in safety."
