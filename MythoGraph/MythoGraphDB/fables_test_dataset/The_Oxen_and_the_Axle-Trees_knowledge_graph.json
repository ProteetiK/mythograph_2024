  "myth_text": "A HEAVY WAGON was being dragged along a country lane by a team of Oxen.\n      The Axle-trees groaned and creaked terribly; whereupon the Oxen, turning\n      round, thus addressed the wheels: Hullo there! why do you make so much\n      noise? We bear all the labor, and we, not you, ought to cry out. Those who suffer most cry out the least."
