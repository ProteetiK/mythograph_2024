See if I do not prick\n      your neck with my sting.\" The Draught-Mule replied, \"I do not heed your\n      threats; I only care for him who sits above you, and who quickens my pace\n      with his whip, or holds me back with the reins. Away, therefore, with your\n      insolence, for I know well when to go fast, and when to go slow.\""
