  "myth_text": "IN THE WINTERTIME, a Dog curled up in as small a space as possible on\n      account of the cold, determined to make himself a house. However when the\n      summer returned again, he lay asleep stretched at his full length and\n      appeared to himself to be of a great size. Now he considered that it would\n      be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as\n      would accommodate him."
