  "myth_text": "A BLIND MAN was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by touching\n      them with his hands. The whelp of a Wolf was brought him, with a request\n      that he would feel it, and say what it was. He felt it, and being in\n      doubt, said: \"I do not quite know whether it is the cub of a Fox, or the\n      whelp of a Wolf, but this I know full well. It would not be safe to admit\n      him to the sheepfold.\" Evil tendencies are shown in early life."
