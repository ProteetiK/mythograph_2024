A Bricklayer\n      earnestly recommended bricks as affording the best material for an\n      effective resistance. A Carpenter, with equal enthusiasm, proposed timber\n      as a preferable method of defense. Upon which a Currier stood up and said,\n      \"Sirs, I differ from you altogether: there is no material for resistance\n      equal to a covering of hides; and nothing so good as leather.\" Every man for himself."
