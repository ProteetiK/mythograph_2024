  "myth_text": "A FOWLER, taking his bird-lime and his twigs, went out to catch birds.\n      Seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree, he wished to take it, and fitting his\n      twigs to a proper length, watched intently, having his whole thoughts\n      directed towards the sky. While thus looking upwards, he unknowingly trod\n      upon a Viper asleep just before his feet. The Viper, turning about, stung\n      him, and falling into a swoon, the man said to himself, \"Woe is me! that\n      while I purposed to hunt another, I am myself fallen unawares into the\n      snares of death.\""
