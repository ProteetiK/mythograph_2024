  "myth_text": "A LARK had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat. The\n      brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of\n      their wings and the full plumage of their feathers, when the owner of the\n      field, looking over his ripe crop, said, \"The time has come when I must\n      ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest.\" One of the young Larks\n      heard his speech and related it to his mother, inquiring of her to what\n      place they should move for safety. \"There is no occasion to move yet, my\n      son,\" she replied; \"the man who only sends to his friends to help him with\n      his harvest is not really in earnest.\" The owner of the field came again a\n      few days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain from excess of\n      ripeness. He said, \"I will come myself tomorrow with my laborers, and with\n      as many reapers as I can hire, and will get in the harvest.\" The Lark on\n      hearing these words said to her brood, \"It is time now to be off, my\n      little ones, for the man is in earnest this time; he no longer trusts his\n      friends, but will reap the field himself.\" Self-help is the best help."
