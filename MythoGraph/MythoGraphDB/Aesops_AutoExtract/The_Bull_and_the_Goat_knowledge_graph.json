  "myth_text": "A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some shepherds had\n      recently occupied. As soon as he entered, a He-Goat left in the cave\n      sharply attacked him with his horns. The Bull quietly addressed him: \"Butt\n      away as much as you will. I have no fear of you, but of the Lion. Let that\n      monster go away and I will soon let you know what is the respective\n      strength of a Goat and a Bull.\" It shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in distress."
