The Sheep, fearing some fraud was intended,\n      excused herself, saying, \"The Wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants\n      and to run off; and you, too, can quickly outstrip me in your rapid\n      flight. How then shall I be able to find you, when the day of payment\n      comes?\" Two blacks do not make one white."
