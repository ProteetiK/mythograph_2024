  "myth_text": "A SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling with men,\n      built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of Justice and there hatched\n      seven young birds. A Serpent gliding past the nest from its hole in the\n      wall ate up the young unfledged nestlings. The Swallow, finding her nest\n      empty, lamented greatly and exclaimed: \"Woe to me a stranger! that in this\n      place where all others' rights are protected, I alone should suffer\n      wrong.\""
