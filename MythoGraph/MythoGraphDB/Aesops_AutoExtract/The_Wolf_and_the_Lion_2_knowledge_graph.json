  "myth_text": "A WOLF, having stolen a lamb from a fold, was carrying him off to his\n      lair. A Lion met him in the path, and seizing the lamb, took it from him.\n      Standing at a safe distance, the Wolf exclaimed, \"You have unrighteously\n      taken that which was mine from me!\" To which the Lion jeeringly replied,\n      \"It was righteously yours, eh? The gift of a friend?\""
