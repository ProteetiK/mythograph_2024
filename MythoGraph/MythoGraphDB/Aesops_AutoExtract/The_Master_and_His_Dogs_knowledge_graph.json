The storm still continuing, he was obliged to slaughter his\n      yoke oxen for food. On seeing this, his Dogs took counsel together, and\n      said, \"It is time for us to be off, for if the master spare not his oxen,\n      who work for his gain, how can we expect him to spare us?\" He is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family."
