  "myth_text": "A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt. A sudden puff of wind\n      blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang forth from his\n      companions. He pulled up his horse, and with great glee joined in the joke\n      by saying, \"What a marvel it is that hairs which are not mine should fly\n      from me, when they have forsaken even the man on whose head they grew.\""
