It\n      fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed: \"I wonder how you, who are\n      so light and weak, are not entirely crushed by these strong winds.\" They\n      replied, \"You fight and contend with the wind, and consequently you are\n      destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of air,\n      and therefore remain unbroken, and escape.\" Stoop to conquer."
