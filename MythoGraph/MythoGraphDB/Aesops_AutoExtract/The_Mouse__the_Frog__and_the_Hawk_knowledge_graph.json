  "myth_text": "A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance formed an\n      intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the most part in the\n      water. The Frog, one day intent on mischief, bound the foot of the Mouse\n      tightly to his own. Thus joined together, the Frog first of all led his\n      friend the Mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their\n      food. After this, he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived,\n      until reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the Mouse\n      with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam croaking about,\n      as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy Mouse was soon suffocated by\n      the water, and his dead body floated about on the surface, tied to the\n      foot of the Frog. A Hawk observed it, and, pouncing upon it with his\n      talons, carried it aloft. The Frog, being still fastened to the leg of the\n      Mouse, was also carried off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk. Harm hatch, harm catch."
