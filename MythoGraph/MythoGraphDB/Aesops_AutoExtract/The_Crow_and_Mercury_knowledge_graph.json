  "myth_text": "A CROW caught in a snare prayed to Apollo to release him, making a vow to\n      offer some frankincense at his shrine. But when rescued from his danger,\n      he forgot his promise. Shortly afterwards, again caught in a snare, he\n      passed by Apollo and made the same promise to offer frankincense to\n      Mercury. Mercury soon appeared and said to him, \"O thou most base fellow?\n      how can I believe thee, who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron?\""
