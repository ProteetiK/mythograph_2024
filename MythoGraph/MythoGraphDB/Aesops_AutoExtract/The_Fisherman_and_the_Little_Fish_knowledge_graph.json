  "myth_text": "A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day caught a single\n      small Fish as the result of his day's labor. The Fish, panting\n      convulsively, thus entreated for his life: \"O Sir, what good can I be to\n      you, and how little am I worth? I am not yet come to my full size. Pray\n      spare my life, and put me back into the sea. I shall soon become a large\n      fish fit for the tables of the rich, and then you can catch me again, and\n      make a handsome profit of me.\" The Fisherman replied, \"I should indeed be\n      a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a greater uncertain profit, I\n      were to forego my present certain gain.\""
