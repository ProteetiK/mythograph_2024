  "myth_text": "A TROUBLESOME CROW seated herself on the back of a Sheep. The Sheep, much\n      against his will, carried her backward and forward for a long time, and at\n      last said, \"If you had treated a dog in this way, you would have had your\n      deserts from his sharp teeth.\" To this the Crow replied, \"I despise the\n      weak and yield to the strong. I know whom I may bully and whom I must\n      flatter; and I thus prolong my life to a good old age.\""
