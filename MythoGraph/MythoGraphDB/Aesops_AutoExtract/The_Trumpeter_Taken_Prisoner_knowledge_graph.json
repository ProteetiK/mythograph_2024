I have not slain a single man of your\n      troop. I have no arms, and carry nothing but this one brass trumpet.\"\n       \"That is the very reason for which you should be put to death,\" they said;\n      \"for, while you do not fight yourself, your trumpet stirs all the others\n      to battle.\""
