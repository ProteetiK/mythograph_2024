  "myth_text": "A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and tormented him\n      with reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor. Shortly\n      afterwards, at the harvest festival, the owner released the Ox from his\n      yoke, but bound the Heifer with cords and led him away to the altar to be\n      slain in honor of the occasion. The Ox saw what was being done, and said\n      with a smile to the Heifer: \"For this you were allowed to live in\n      idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed.\""
