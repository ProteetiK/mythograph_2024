  "myth_text": "ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general thirst among the\n      beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a small well to\n      drink. They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first, and were\n      soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat. When they stopped suddenly\n      to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some\n      Vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one that should fall\n      first. They at once made up their quarrel, saying, \"It is better for us to\n      make friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures.\""
