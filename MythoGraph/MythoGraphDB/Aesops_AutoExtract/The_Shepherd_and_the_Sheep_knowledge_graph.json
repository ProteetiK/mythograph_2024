  "myth_text": "A SHEPHERD driving his Sheep to a wood, saw an oak of unusual size full of\n      acorns, and spreading his cloak under the branches, he climbed up into the\n      tree and shook them down. The Sheep eating the acorns inadvertently frayed\n      and tore the cloak. When the Shepherd came down and saw what was done, he\n      said, \"O you most ungrateful creatures! You provide wool to make garments\n      for all other men, but you destroy the clothes of him who feeds you.\""
