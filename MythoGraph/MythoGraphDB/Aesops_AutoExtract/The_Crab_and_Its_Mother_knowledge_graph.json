It is far\n      more becoming to go straight forward.\" The young Crab replied: \"Quite\n      true, dear Mother; and if you will show me the straight way, I will\n      promise to walk in it.\" The Mother tried in vain, and submitted without\n      remonstrance to the reproof of her child. Example is more powerful than precept."
