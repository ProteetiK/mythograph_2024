Just as\n      he was about to fly off, he made a buzzing noise, and inquired of the Bull\n      if he would like him to go. The Bull replied, \"I did not know you had\n      come, and I shall not miss you when you go away.\" Some men are of more consequence in their own eyes than in the eyes of\n      their neighbors."
