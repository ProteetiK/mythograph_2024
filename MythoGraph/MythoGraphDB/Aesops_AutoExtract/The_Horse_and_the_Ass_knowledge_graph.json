  "myth_text": "A HORSE, proud of his fine trappings, met an Ass on the highway. The Ass,\n      being heavily laden, moved slowly out of the way. \"Hardly,\" said the\n      Horse, \"can I resist kicking you with my heels.\" The Ass held his peace,\n      and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods. Not long\n      afterwards the Horse, having become broken-winded, was sent by his owner\n      to the farm. The Ass, seeing him drawing a dungcart, thus derided him:\n      \"Where, O boaster, are now all thy gay trappings, thou who are thyself\n      reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt?\""
