  "myth_text": "A MAN once kept a Goat and an Ass. The Goat, envying the Ass on account of\n      his greater abundance of food, said, \"How shamefully you are treated: at\n      one time grinding in the mill, and at another carrying heavy burdens;\" and\n      he further advised him to pretend to be epileptic and fall into a ditch\n      and so obtain rest. The Ass listened to his words, and falling into a\n      ditch, was very much bruised. His master, sending for a leech, asked his\n      advice. He bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a Goat. They at once\n      killed the Goat, and so healed the Ass."
