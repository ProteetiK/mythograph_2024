  "myth_text": "A SAILOR, bound on a long voyage, took with him a Monkey to amuse him\n      while on shipboard. As he sailed off the coast of Greece, a violent\n      tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he, his Monkey, and all\n      the crew were obliged to swim for their lives. A Dolphin saw the Monkey\n      contending with the waves, and supposing him to be a man (whom he is\n      always said to befriend), came and placed himself under him, to convey him\n      on his back in safety to the shore. When the Dolphin arrived with his\n      burden in sight of land not far from Athens, he asked the Monkey if he\n      were an Athenian. The latter replied that he was, and that he was\n      descended from one of the most noble families in that city. The Dolphin\n      then inquired if he knew the Piraeus (the famous harbor of Athens).\n      Supposing that a man was meant, the Monkey answered that he knew him very\n      well and that he was an intimate friend. The Dolphin, indignant at these\n      falsehoods, dipped the Monkey under the water and drowned him."
