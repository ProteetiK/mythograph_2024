  "myth_text": "A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed in his\n      lair. Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was passing, and\n      asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing close beside him.\n      \"For,\" he said, \"if you will bring me drink, I will find means to provide\n      myself with meat.\" \"Yes,\" said the Sheep, \"if I should bring you the\n      draught, you would doubtless make me provide the meat also.\" Hypocritical speeches are easily seen through."
