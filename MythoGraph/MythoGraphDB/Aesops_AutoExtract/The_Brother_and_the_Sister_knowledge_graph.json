  "myth_text": "A FATHER had one son and one daughter, the former remarkable for his good\n      looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness. While they were playing\n      one day as children, they happened by chance to look together into a\n      mirror that was placed on their mother's chair. The boy congratulated\n      himself on his good looks; the girl grew angry, and could not bear the\n      self-praises of her Brother, interpreting all he said (and how could she\n      do otherwise?) into reflection on herself. She ran off to her father, to\n      be avenged on her Brother, and spitefully accused him of having, as a boy,\n      made use of that which belonged only to girls. The father embraced them\n      both, and bestowing his kisses and affection impartially on each, said, \"I\n      wish you both would look into the mirror every day: you, my son, that you\n      may not spoil your beauty by evil conduct; and you, my daughter, that you\n      may make up for your lack of beauty by your virtues.\""
