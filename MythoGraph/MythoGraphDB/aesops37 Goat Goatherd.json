  "myth_text": "A GOATHERD had sought to bring back a stray goat to his flock. He whistled and sounded his horn in vain; the straggler paid no attention to the summons. At last the Goatherd threw a stone, and breaking its horn, begged the Goat not to tell his master. The Goat replied, \"Why, you silly fellow, the horn will speak though I be silent.\" Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hid."
