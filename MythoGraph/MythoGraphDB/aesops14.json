  "myth_text": "A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: \"Why do you stand there gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly.\"The Dog, wagging his tail, replied: \"O, master! I am quite ready; it is you for whom I am waiting.\"The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend."
