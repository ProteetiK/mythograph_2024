  "myth_text": "THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected in the summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, \"Why did you not treasure up food during the summer?\" He replied, \"I had not leisure enough. I passed the days in singing.\" They then said in derision: \"If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must dance supperless to bed in the winter.\""
