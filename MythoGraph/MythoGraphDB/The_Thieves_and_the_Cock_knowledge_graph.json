Upon arriving at home they\n      prepared to kill the Cock, who thus pleaded for his life: \"Pray spare me;\n      I am very serviceable to men. I wake them up in the night to their work.\"\n       \"That is the very reason why we must the more kill you,\" they replied;\n      \"for when you wake your neighbors, you entirely put an end to our\n      business.\" The safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions."
