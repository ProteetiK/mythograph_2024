Ge - Variation - 1.txt,"Noticing that a pair of macaws had built their nest on top of a steep rock, a Indian took his young brother-in-law, Botoque, with him to help him to capture the nestlings. He made Botoque climb up an improvised ladder; but when the Botoque got up to the nest, he said that he could find only two eggs. (It is not clear whether he was lying or telling the truth.) His brother-in-law insisted that Botoque should take them; but as the eggs fell down, they changed into stones which hurt the older man's hand. This made him furious, with the result that he dismantled the ladder and went away, not realizing that the birds were enchanted (oaianga) (?). Botoque remained caught on top of the rock for several days. He grew thin: hunger and thirst obliged him to eat his own excrement. Eventually Botoque noticed a spotted Jaguar carrying a bow and arrow and all kinds of game. Botoque would have liked to call out to it for help, but fear kept Botoque silent. The Jaguar saw the Botoque's shadow on the ground and, after trying in vain to catch it, looked up, asked what had happened, repaired the ladder, and invited Botoque to come down. The Botoque was afraid and hesitated a long time; in the end Botoque made up his mind, and the Jaguar, in friendly fashion, suggested that if Botoque would sit astride its back, it would take him to its home to have a meal of grilled meat. But the Botoque did not understand the meaning of the word ""grilled"" because in those days, the Indians were unacquainted with fire and ate their meat raw. At the Jaguar's home the Botoque saw a big jatoba trunk burning; beside it was a pile of stones such as the Indians now use to build their earth ovens. He ate his first meal of cooked meat. But the Jaguar's Wife, who was a Indian, disliked the young man and referred to him as me-on\ra-tum ""foreign, or abandoned, son""; in spite of this, the Jaguar, being childless, decided to adopt him. Each day the Jaguar went off to hunt, leaving the adopted Botoque with the Wife whose aversion for him steadily increased; she gave him only old wizened pieces of meat to eat, and leaves. When the Botoque complained, she scratched his face, and the poor Botoque had to take refuge in the forest. The Jaguar scolded the Wife, but in vain. One day it gave Botoque a brand new bow and some arrows, taught Botoque how to use them, and advised Botoque to use them against the Wife, should the need arise. Botoque killed Wife by shooting an arrow into her breast. Botoque fled in terror, taking with Botoque the weapons and a piece of grilled meat. Botoque reached his village in the middle of the night, groped his way to his mother's bed, and had some difficulty in making his identity known (because he was thought to be dead); Botoque told his tale and shared the meat. The Indians decided to get possession of the fire. When they arrived at the Jaguar's home, there was no one there; and since the Wife was dead, the game caught the day before had not been cooked. The Indians roasted it and took away the fire. For the very first time it was possible to have light in the village at night, to eat cooked meat, and to warm oneself at a hearth. But the Jaguar, incensed by the ingratitude of his adopted son, who had stolen ""fire and the secret of the bow and arrow,"" was to remain full of hatred for all living creatures, especially human beings. Now only the reflection of fire could be seen in its eyes. It used its fangs for hunting and ate its meat raw, having solemnly renounced grilled meat.",4,Fire
Ge - Variation - 2.txt,"Formerly, men did not know how to make fire. When they killed game, they cut the flesh into thin strips, which they laid out on stones to dry in the sun. They also ate rotten wood. One day a man noticed two macaws coming out of a hole in a cliff. To get at their nest, he made his young brother-in-law (his Wife's brother) climb a tree trunk in which he had cut foot holds. But there were nothing but round stones in the nest. An argument ensued, degenerating into a quarrel. The Hero, annoyed by his brother-in-law's taunts, threw the stones deliberately and wounded him. In response to his Wife's anxious inquiries, the man said the boy must have got lost, and to allay suspicion, he pretended to go and look for him. Meanwhile, suffering extreme hunger and thirst, the Hero was reduced to eating his excrement and drinking his urine. Hero was nothing but skin and bone when a Jaguar came along carrying a caititu pig on his shoulders; the animal noticed the Hero's shadow and tried to catch it. On each occasion the Hero moved back and the shadow disappeared. ""The Jaguar looked all round, then covering its mouth, looked up and saw the Hero on the rock."" They entered into conversation. The Hero was too frightened to sit directly on the Jaguar but agreed to bestride the caititu, which the latter was carrying on his back. They reached the Jaguar's home, where his Wife was busy spinning. Wife reproached her husband, saying ""you have brought home another's son."" Unperturbed, the Jaguar announced that he was going to adopt the Hero as his companion, and intended to feed him and fatten him up. But the Jaguar's Wife refused to give the Hero any tapir meat and allowed Hero only venison and threatened to scratch Hero at the slightest opportunity. Acting on the Jaguar's advice, the Hero killed the woman with the bow and arrow given him by his protector. Hero went off with the Jaguar's belongings: the spun cotton, the meat, and the burning ash. When Hero reached his village, Hero made himself known first to his sister, then to his mother. Hero was summoned to the ngobe ""men's house,"" where he related his adventures. The Indians decided to change themselves into animals to take possession of the fire: the tapir would carry the trunk, the yao bird would put out the burning ash that might be dropped on the way, while the deer would take charge of the meat, and the peccary of the spun cotton. The expedition was a success, and the men shared the fire between them.",4,Fire
