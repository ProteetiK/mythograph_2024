A young widower, who was sleeping out in the open air, fell in love with a star. The star appeared to him first of all in the form of a frog, then in the form of a beautiful young woman, whom he married. At that time men knew nothing of gardening, and they ate rotten wood with their meat instead of vegetables. Star-woman brought her husband sweet potatoes and yams and taught him to eat them. The man carefully hid his tiny wife in a gourd, where she was discovered by his younger brother. From then on he lived openly with her. One day, while Star-woman was bathing with her mother-in-law, she changed into an opossum and jumped on the old woman's shoulder until she drew the latter's attention to a large tree laden with cobs of maize. She explained that "the Indians were to eat this maize instead of rotten wood." As an opossum, she climbed up and threw down quantities of cobs. Then she reassumed human shape and showed her mother-in-law how to make maize cakes. Delighted with this new food, men decided to chop down the maize tree with a stone axe. But when they stopped for breath, the notch they had cut closed up again. They sent two boys to the village for a better axe. On the way the two discovered a steppe opossum, which they killed and immediately roasted and consumed, though this animal is taboo to boys. Hardly had they finished their meal when they turned into senile, stooping old men. An old magician-doctor succeeded in restoring their youth. When the men had finally felled the tree with great difficulty, Star-woman advised them to make a clearing and plant maize. Star-woman, however, later returned to the sky after her husband's death.
