Formerly Men used to hunt and store their supply of game on the thatched roofs of their huts. One day, in Men's absence, a group of Women came down from the sky and stole all the meat. The same thing happened the next day, and the Men, who did not know that Women existed, set Rabbit to watch. But Rabbit slept all the time, and the grilled meat was stolen. The next day Parrot stood guard, hidden in a quebracho tree, and he saw the Women, who had toothed vaginas. After remaining quiet and motionless at first, Parrot threw a fruit down from the tree onto the Women who were feasting below. The Women began by accusing each other; then they discovered Parrot and began to fight about whose husband he should be. Women threw things at each other, and one of the sticks went astray and broke the bone under the parrot's tongue. Being now struck dumb and compelled to express himself through gestures, Parrot could not make the Men understand what had happened. It was now Hawk's turn to mount guard, and Hawk took care to arm himself with two throwing sticks. The first missed its target and enabled the Women to discover him; but although Women fought with each other about who should have him as husband and then tried in vain to kill him by throwing things at him, with his second stick Hawk succeeded in cutting one of the two ropes used by the Women to travel up and down from the sky (one rope was for pretty Women with fair complexions, the other for old, ugly ones). Several Women fell down and sank into the earth, but not before Hawk had captured two Women for his own use. Hawk then called to his Men. Only Iguana could hear him, but since Iguana had very small ears, the other Men refused to admit that his hearing could be keener than theirs. Eventually Hawk managed to make himself audible to Men. . . . Armadillo extracted the Women from the earth and distributed them among Men.
