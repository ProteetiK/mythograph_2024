Tupan (the culture hero) traveled on this earth accompanied by his young godchild. One day they came to a large village where several relatives of his godchild lived; and Tupan left the child with these relatives, instructing them to treat him well. They did not, however, care for the boy; and on Tupan's return the boy complained of the bad treatment he had received. Tupan was angry. He told the boy to gather all the feathers he could find and to spread them around the edge of the village. Then Tupan set fire to the feathers, and the entire village was surrounded by the walls of fire. The inhabitants ran from side to side, but they were unable to escape. Little by little their cries became lower until they were transformed into the grunts of pigs; at the same time the people began to take on the form of peccaries and wild pigs. A few of them escaped into the dense forest, and the wild pigs that inhabit the forest today are their descendants. Tupan made his godchild, Marana-ywa, the owner of wild pigs.
