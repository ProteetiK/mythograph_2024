Two brothers lived with their sister in an abandoned hut. One of them fell in love with the young girl; he lay with her every night without telling her who he was. The other brother discovered that his sister was pregnant, and commanded her to rub the face of her nocturnal visitor with genipa juice. When the guilty brother realized that the stains betrayed him, he fled up into the sky with his sister. But after arriving there, they quarreled; the man gave the woman a push, and she fell like a meteor and landed on the earth very noisily; she turned into a tapir, while the incestuous brother, who had remained in the sky, became the moon. The other brother summoned the warriors and ordered them to shoot arrows at the moon and kill it. Only the armadillo succeeded in wounding it. The moon's blood was of all colors, and men and women were bespattered with it as it streamed earthward. The women wiped themselves with an upward movement, so they came under the moon's influence. The men, however, wiped themselves clean with a downward movement. The birds bathed in the different colored pools, and each species thus acquired its characteristic plumage.
