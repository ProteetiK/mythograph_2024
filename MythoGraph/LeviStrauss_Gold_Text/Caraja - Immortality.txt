At the beginning of time Men lived with their ancestor, Kaboi, in the bowels of the earth, where the sun shone when it was dark outside, and vice versa. From time to time the cry of a savannah Bird, the seriema, could be heard, and one day Kaboi decided to set off in the direction from which the sound came. Accompanied by a few Men, Kaboi came to a hole that Kaboi was unable to climb through because Kaboi was very fat; and Kaboi's companions emerged without Kaboi onto the earth's surface, which they started to explore. There were great quantities of fruit, bees, and honey, and they noticed also dead trees and dry wood. Men brought back to Kaboi samples of all they had found. Kaboi examined them and concluded that the earth was a beautiful and fertile place, but that the presence of dead wood proved that everything was doomed to perish. Men would do better to stay where Men were. For in Kaboi's kingdom, Men lived until age made them incapable of moving. A number of Kaboi's "children" refused to listen to him, and came to take up their abode on the earth's surface. For this reason, Men die much sooner than those of their fellows who chose to remain in the underworld.
