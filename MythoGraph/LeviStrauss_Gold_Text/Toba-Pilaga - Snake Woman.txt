There was a girl who had a continual flow of menstrual blood. "Does your period never finish?" she was asked. The girl would answer, "Only when my husband is here." But nobody knew who her husband was. Moreover the Girl laughed incessantly. It was eventually discovered that Girl spent all her time sitting in her hut just above a hole occupied by her husband, the python. A trap was laid for the latter, and he was killed. And when the Girl gave birth to six little snakes, all spotted, they too were killed. The Girl changed into an iguana.
