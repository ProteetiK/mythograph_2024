He therefore ordered the entire population of a village to cross a wide river by means of a bridge made from a tree trunk, which he had specially chosen because it was not very strong. It did, in fact, snap under the load; and all the people perished, with the exception of one man called Akaruio Bokodori, who could only walk slowly because his legs were deformed. The hair of those who were sucked into the whirlpools turned wavy or curly; the hair of those who drowned in calm waters was fine and smooth. This became clear after Akaruio Bokodori had brought them all back to life by incantations with a drum accompaniment.

Ge - Variation - 4.txt,"Formerly men were unacquainted with fire and dried their meat by laying it out in the sun on a flat stone, so that it was not completely raw. In those days a man once took his young brother-in-law on an expedition to rob macaws' nests in a cleft of a vertical cliff. But the fledglings made such an outcry that the boy did not dare take hold of them. The man grew angry, knocked down the ladder, and went off. The hero remained sitting by the nest, suffering from thirst, his head covered with birds' droppings, ""so that maggots grew there; and the young birds soon lost all fear of him."" What follows is identical with the Apinaye version. It is explained, however, that the jaguar's wife was pregnant and could not bear the slightest noise; she therefore flew into a rage whenever the hero made a noise as he chewed the grilled meat his adopted father had given him. But try as he might, he could not eat silently, since the meat was too crisp. With the weapons given him by the jaguar, he wounded the wife in the paw and fled. The wife, hampered by her pregnancy, was unable to follow him. The hero recounted his adventure to his father, who summoned all his companions. They placed runners at intervals all the way to the jaguar's house and organized a relay system: the burning log was passed from hand to hand and finally reached the village. The jaguar's wife begged them in vain to leave her a burning ember; the toad spat on all those that remained, and put them out.",4,Fire

The man made his brother-in-law climb a pole; but when he got up there, the young man declared that there were only eggs there. When the man said he knew there were young in the nest, the hero took a white stone in his mouth and threw it down. The stone turned into an egg that was smashed against the ground. The man was angry, pulled away the ladder, and went home, leaving the hero in the tree where he was forced to remain for five days. Then a jaguar passed by and asked what he was doing up there, made him first throw down the two young macaws (which were in fact in the nest), told him to jump after them, and, growling, caught the boy between his front paws. Then the boy was very much afraid, but nothing happened to him. The jaguar carried the hero on his shoulders until they came to a creek. Although the boy was suffering greatly from thirst, he was not allowed to drink, because, as the jaguar explained, the water belonged to the camon vulture (urubu). The same thing happened at the second creek, because the water there belonged to ""the little birds."" Finally, at the third creek, the hero drank so much as to drain the whole creek, in spite of the entreaties of the alligator, 15 the owner of the creek. The hero was given a chilly welcome by the jaguar's wife, who reproached her husband for having brought back ""a lean and ugly boy."" She called the boy to delouse her, but when she had him between her paws, she frightened him with her growls. He complained to the jaguar, who made him a bow and arrows and ornaments, gave him two basketfuls of roast meat, and helped him back to his village, after advising him to aim for the wife's carotid, should she try to pursue him. Everything happened as had been foreseen, and the wife was killed. Shortly afterward the young man heard people coming. It was his two brothers, to whom he revealed his identity, and who ran home to tell their mother. ""You lie,"" said their mother. ""He's been dead long since."" But the boy concealed himself again. He came out of hiding on the occasion of the Aikman funeral festival. Everybody was amazed when they saw the roast meat he had brought back. ""Why, how is it roasted?"" ""In the sunshine,"" the boy kept repeating, although he finally revealed the truth to his uncle. An expedition was organized to capture fire from the jaguar.

Ge - Variation - 1.txt,"Noticing that a pair of macaws had built their nest on top of a steep rock, a Indian took his young brother-in-law, Botoque, with him to help him to capture the nestlings. He made Botoque climb up an improvised ladder; but when the boy got up to the nest, he said that he could find only two eggs. (It is not clear whether he was lying or telling the truth.) His brother-in-law insisted that he should take them; but as the eggs fell down, they changed into stones which hurt the older man's hand. This made him furious, with the result that he dismantled the ladder and went away, not realizing that the birds were enchanted (oaianga) (?). Botoque remained caught on top of the rock for several days. He grew thin: hunger and thirst obliged him to eat his own excrement. Eventually he noticed a spotted jaguar carrying a bow and arrow and all kinds of game. He would have liked to call out to it for help, but fear kept him silent. The jaguar saw the hero's shadow on the ground and, after trying in vain to catch it, looked up, asked what had happened, repaired the ladder, and invited Botoque to come down. The latter was afraid and hesitated a long time; in the end he made up his mind, and the jaguar, in friendly fashion, suggested that if he would sit astride its back, it would take him to its home to have a meal of grilled meat. But the young man did not understand the meaning of the word ""grilled"" because in those days, the Indians were unacquainted with fire and ate their meat raw. At the jaguar's home the hero saw a big jatoba trunk burning; beside it was a pile of stones such as the Indians now use to build their earth ovens. He ate his first meal of cooked meat. But the jaguar's wife, who was a Indian, disliked the young man and referred to him as me-on\ra-tum ""foreign, or abandoned, son""; in spite of this, the jaguar, being childless, decided to adopt him. Each day the jaguar went off to hunt, leaving the adopted son with the wife whose aversion for him steadily increased; she gave him only old wizened pieces of meat to eat, and leaves. When the boy complained, she scratched his face, and the poor child had to take refuge in the forest. The jaguar scolded the wife, but in vain. One day it gave Botoque a brand new bow and some arrows, taught him how to use them, and advised him to use them against the woman, should the need arise. Botoque killed her by shooting an arrow into her breast. He fled in terror, taking with him the weapons and a piece of grilled meat. He reached his village in the middle of the night, groped his way to his mother's bed, and had some difficulty in making his identity known (because he was thought to be dead); he told his tale and shared the meat. The Indians decided to get possession of the fire. When they arrived at the jaguar's home, there was no one there; and since the wife was dead, the game caught the day before had not been cooked. The Indians roasted it and took away the fire. For the very first time it was possible to have light in the village at night, to eat cooked meat, and to warm oneself at a hearth. But the jaguar, incensed by the ingratitude of his adopted son, who had stolen ""fire and the secret of the bow and arrow,"" was to remain full of hatred for all living creatures, especially human beings. Now only the reflection of fire could be seen in its eyes. It used its fangs for hunting and ate its meat raw, having solemnly renounced grilled meat.",4,Fire
Ge - Variation - 2.txt,"Formerly, men did not know how to make fire. When they killed game, they cut the flesh into thin strips, which they laid out on stones to dry in the sun. They also ate rotten wood. One day a man noticed two macaws coming out of a hole in a cliff. To get at their nest, he made his young brother-in-law (his wife's brother) climb a tree trunk in which he had cut foot holds. But there were nothing but round stones in the nest. An argument ensued, degenerating into a quarrel, which ended as in the previous version. In this case, however, it seems that the lad, annoyed by his brother-in-law's taunts, threw the stones deliberately and wounded him. In response to his wife's anxious inquiries, the man said the boy must have got lost, and to allay suspicion, he pretended to go and look for him. Meanwhile, suffering extreme hunger and thirst, the hero was reduced to eating his excrement and drinking his urine. He was nothing but skin and bone when a jaguar came along carrying a caititu pig on his shoulders; the animal noticed the boy's shadow and tried to catch it. On each occasion the hero moved back and the shadow disappeared. ""The jaguar looked all round, then covering its mouth, looked up and saw the lad on the rock."" They entered into conversation. Explanations and discussions took place as in the preceding version. The hero was too frightened to sit directly on the jaguar but agreed to bestride the caititu, which the latter was carrying on his back. They reached the jaguar's home, where his wife was busy spinning. She reproached her husband, saying ""you have brought home another's son."" Unperturbed, the jaguar announced that he was going to adopt the boy as his companion, and intended to feed him and fatten him up. But the jaguar's wife refused to give the lad any tapir meat and allowed him only venison and threatened to scratch him at the slightest opportunity. Acting on the jaguar's advice, the boy killed the woman with the bow and arrow given him by his protector. He went off with the jaguar's belongings: the spun cotton, the meat, and the burning ash. When he reached his village, he made himself known first to his sister, then to his mother. He was summoned to the ngobe ""men's house,"" where he related his adventures. The Indians decided to change themselves into animals to take possession of the fire: the tapir would carry the trunk, the yao bird would put out the burning ash that might be dropped on the way, while the deer would take charge of the meat, and the peccary of the spun cotton. The expedition was a success, and the men shared the fire between them.",4,Fire
Ge - Variation - 3.txt,"A man found a macaw's nest with two young birds in a high and vertical cliff. He took his little brother-in-law along, chopped down a tree, leaned it against the wall of rock, and bade the boy climb. The boy went up, but the parent birds rushed at him with fierce screams; so he got frightened. Then the man got angry, knocked the tree aside, and left. The boy, unable to descend, remained sitting by the nest for five days. He nearly died of thirst and hunger. He was completely covered by the droppings of the macaws and swallows that flew above him. Then a jaguar came past, saw the boy's shadow, and tried in vain to catch it. Then the boy spat down, and now the jaguar raised his head and saw him. They entered into conversation. The jaguar demanded to have the two young macaws, which the hero flung down to him one after the other, and which he immediately devoured. Then the jaguar brought up the tree and asked the boy to step down, promising him that he would not eat him, and that he would give him water to quench his thirst. Somewhat hesitantly, the hero complied. The jaguar took him on his back and carried him to a creek. The boy drank his fill and fell asleep. At last the jaguar pinched his arm and awakened him. He washed the dirt off him and said that, having no children, he would take him home as his son. In the jaguar's home a huge jatoba trunk was lying on the floor and burning at one end. In those days the Indians were unacquainted with fire and ate only flesh dried in the sun. ""What is smoking there?"" asked the boy. ""That is fire,"" answered the jaguar. ""You will find out at night when it warms you."" Then he gave the roast meat to the boy, who ate till he fell asleep. At midnight he woke up, ate again, and then again fell asleep. Before daybreak the jaguar went hunting. The boy climbed a tree to await his return. But toward noon he got hungry, returned to the jaguar's house, and begged his wife for food. ""What!"" she shouted, baring her teeth. ""Look here!"" The hero cried out from fear and ran to meet the jaguar and told him of the occurrence. The jaguar scolded his wife, who excused herself, saying that she was merely jesting. But the same scene occurred again the next day. Following the advice of the jaguar (who had made him a bow and arrow and told him to shoot at a termite's nest), the boy killed the aggressive wife. His adopted father said, ""That does not matter,"" gave him a lot of roast meat, and explained to him how to return to his village by following along the creek. But he was to be on guard: if a rock or the aroeira tree called him, he should answer; but was to keep still if he heard ""the gentle call of a rotten tree."" The hero moved along the brook, replied to the first two calls and, forgetting the jaguar's warnings, to the third as well. That is why men are short-lived: if the boy had answered only the first two, they would enjoy as long life as the rock and the aroeira tree. After a while the boy again heard a call and replied to it. It was Magalon kamdure, an ogre, who tried unsuccessfully to pass himself off as the hero's father by means of various disguises (long hair, ear ornaments). When the hero finally discovered the ogre's identity, the latter wrestled with him until he was quite worn out, whereupon he put the boy in his big carrying basket. On his way home the ogre stopped to hunt coatis. Speaking from inside the basket, the hero called to him to make a trail through the woods first, so he could carry the load better. While the ogre was doing this, the hero escaped, after weighting the basket with a heavy stone. When the ogre reached home, he promised his children a choice morsel, even better than the coatis. But all he found in the bottom of the basket was a stone. Meanwhile the boy had found his way back to his village, where he related his adventures. All the Indians set off to look for the fire. Various animals offered their help: the jao was to extinguish the fallen embers; the jacu was spurned, but the tapir was considered strong enough to carry the tree. The jaguar gave them the fire.

After a time the jaguar wearied of carrying the meat and, through his wife, proposed that he should settle in the village. The father agreed. (He was afraid of the jaguar, but he was fond of meat.) Besides, the woman explained that the jaguar would not set up his hut too close to that of his parents-in-law; he would build it some distance away, so as not to be seen.

They expressed a desire for honey; the honey their brother-in-law invited them to eat in his hut was thick, sticky, and full of scum, because he had copulated with his wife while he was busy collecting it.

Man kept the pure honey for his Son, and for his Woman prepared a mixture composed of honey and the flesh of snake embryos taken from the belly of the one Man had killed. No sooner had the Woman begun to eat her portion than her body started to itch. As Woman scratched herself, she announced to her Man that Woman was about to devour Man. Man ran away and climbed to the top of a tree where there was a parrot's nest. He kept the Woman quiet temporarily by throwing to Woman the three nestlings, one after the other. While Woman was chasing the largest which was trying to flutter away from Woman, the Man ran off in the direction of a pit that he himself had dug for the purpose of catching game. Man avoided the pit, but the Woman fell into it and was killed. The Man filled in the hole and kept watch over it. An unknown plant eventually sprouted there. Out of curiosity the Man dried the leaves in the sun; at nightfall he smoked in great secret. Man's companions caught him at it and asked what he was doing. Thus it was that men came to have tobacco.",7,Tobacco
Bororo - Pigs.txt,"Day after day the Men would go fishing and catch nothing. Men would return to the village in a sad state of mind, not only because they were empty-handed, but also because their Women were sulking and gave them a poor welcome. The Women even got to the point of challenging the Men. Women declared that they would do the fishing. But in actual fact all Women did was to call on otters, who dived and fished in their stead. The Women returned laden with fish, and each time the Men tried to get their own back, Men caught nothing. After a time the Men suspected some sort of trick. They had the Women spied on by a Bird who revealed the truth. The next day, the Men went to the river, called the Otters, and strangled them one after another. Only one escaped. It was now the Men's turn to jeer at the Women, who caught nothing. The Women therefore determined to be avenged. Women offered Men a drink made with piqui fruits, whose kernels they had left covered with spikes. Choked by these spikes which stuck in their throats, the Men grunted, and were changed into wild pigs that give this cry.",5,Pigs
Tobo-Pilaga - Tobacco.txt,"One day a Woman and her Man went to catch parakeets. The Man climbed a tree containing several nests and threw down thirty or so fledglings to his Woman. He noticed that Woman gobbled them up. Seized with fear, Man caught hold of a larger bird and, as Man threw it down, called out, ""Here comes a fledgling, but look out, it can fly."" The Woman ran after the bird, and the Man took advantage of the situation to climb down and run away: Man was afraid Woman might eat him, too. But his Woman went after him, caught up with Man, and killed him. Then Woman cut off Man's head, which she put in a bag, and feasted on the rest of the body until her stomach was full. Woman had scarcely returned to the village when she felt thirsty. Before going to the drinking pool, which was some distance away, Woman forbade her five children to touch the bag. But the youngest immediately looked inside and called the others, who recognized their father. The whole village was now informed, and everybody took fright and ran away, except the children. When the Woman, on her return, was surprised to find the village empty, they explained that the villagers had left after insulting them, having fled through shame at their own spitefulness. The Woman was indignant and, wishing to avenge her children, went after the villagers. Woman caught up with them, killed a number of them, and devoured the bodies there and then. The same process was repeated several times. Terrified by these bloody comings and goings, the children wanted to escape. ""Do not try to run away,"" said the Woman, ""lest I eat you, too."" The children implored her. ""No, don't be afraid,"" Woman replied. No one was able to kill Woman, and the rumor soon spread that she was a jaguar-woman. The children secretly dug a pit, which they covered with branches. They took flight when their mother announced to them that their turn had now come to be eaten. Woman rushed after them and fell into the trap. The children went to ask for help from Carancho (the culture hero, a species of falcon, simultaneously a bird of prey and a carrion-eater), who advised them to hollow out a tree trunk and hide inside with him. The jaguar-woman tried to tear the tree with her claws, but they remained caught in the wood, so that Carancho was able to come out and kill her. Her corpse was burned on a woodpile. Four or five days later a plant sprang up from the ashes. This was the first appearance of tobacco. The claws were used to make collars for dogs, which were sent to all the villages, so that no one would be in doubt about the death of the jaguar-woman.",7,Tobacco
Warao - Stars.txt,"Once upon a time there were two brothers, the elder Man was a celebrated hunter. Each day he went a little farther afield in search of game, with the result that finally he came to a creek he had never seen before. He climbed into a tree standing at its edge so as to watch for the animals that came to drink. Suddenly he saw a Woman wading through the water toward him, and he thought her behavior very curious. Each time Woman put her hand into the creek Woman brought out two fish, and each time Woman ate one of them and put the other into her basket. Woman was a very big Woman, a supernatural being. On her head Woman was wearing a calabash, which Woman occasionally took off and threw into the water in such a way as to make it spin like a top. When Woman did this, Woman would stop to watch it, and afterward Woman would walk on again. The hunter spent the night up the tree and returned to the village the next day. Man told the story to his young Man, who begged to go with him in order to see ""such a Woman who can catch so many fish and can eat them as well."" ""No,"" was the reply, ""because you are always laughing at everything, and you might laugh at her."" But the young man promised to keep a straight face, and the elder Man allowed himself to be persuaded. When they reached the stream, the elder Man climbed into his tree, which stood a little way back from the edge; the younger one insisted on taking up his position in a better-placed tree, so as to miss nothing, and Man sat on a branch overhanging the water. The Woman soon arrived and began behaving as before. When Woman reached the spot directly beneath the young Man, Woman noticed the reflection of his shadow in the water. Woman tried to catch hold of it, and when Woman failed, kept on trying: ""Woman put her hand in quickly, first to this side and then that, but of course Woman did not succeed, and what with all her queer gesticulations and funny capers made so ridiculous an appearance that the Man up above could not resist laughing at her vain attempts to seize the substance for the shadow. Man laughed and laughed and could not stop laughing."" Thereupon the Woman looked up and spied the two Mans. Furious at having been laughed at, Woman launched an attack with poisonous ants; they bit and stung the boy so badly that, to escape from them, Man had to throw himself into the water, where the Woman caught him and ate him. Afterward Woman captured the other Man and put him in her well-secured basket. On returning to her hut, Woman put the basket down and forbade her two daughters to touch it. But as soon as her back was turned, her daughters lost no time in opening it. They were delighted with the hero's physical appearance and his talents as a hunter. Both of them, indeed, fell in love with him, and the younger one hid him in her hammock. When the time came for the ogress to kill and eat her prisoner, the daughters confessed their misdeeds. Their mother agreed to spare her unexpected son-in-law, on condition that Man go fishing on her behalf. But however big the catch Man brought back, the ogress would devour it all, apart from two fish. Eventually the hero was so worn out that Man fell ill. The younger daughter, who was by now his wife, agreed to run away with him. One day Man told his mother-in-law that Man had left his catch in his canoe, and that Woman should go and fetch it (a fisherman was not supposed to carry the fish himself, since this would spoil his luck). However, Man had arranged for a shark, or an alligator, to be under the canoe, and the ogress was devoured. The elder daughter discovered the murder, sharpened her knife, and pursued the culprit. When Woman was about to catch up with him, Man ordered his wife to climb a tree, and followed after her. But Man was not quick enough to prevent his sister-in-law cutting off one of his legs. The detached member sprang to life and became the mother of birds.

Fearing their parents' anger, Children fled into the sky by climbing up a knotty creeper that the hummingbird had agreed to fasten in position. Meanwhile the Women came back to the village and looked for the children. Women questioned the tongueless Grandmother and macaw to no purpose. One of Women caught sight of the creeper with the Children climbing up it. When pressed to come down, the Children turned a deaf ear and even climbed still faster.

One day Men noticed that their supplies of food had been stolen, so Men left a parrot on guard. The bird, from its perch at the top of a tree, saw Women coming down from the sky by the means of a rope. Women ate as much as they could and went to sleep in the shade of the tree. Instead of giving the alarm as he had been instructed to do, the parrot began to throw pieces of wood at the Women, who woke up and discovered him. Women bombarded Parrot with seeds, one of which hit the bird's tongue, which has been black ever since. The iguana heard the sound of the fight and informed his companions; but believing him to be deaf, they refused to pay any attention. The parrot meanwhile had been struck dumb. The next day the lizard mounted guard, but the Women captured him and tore out his tongue, so that he, too, was struck dumb. The Men, after a discussion, entrusted the village to the care of the hawk, which could not be seen by the Women because the color of its plumage was indistinguishable from that of the trunk of the tree in which it was perched. The hawk gave the alarm; although the Women threw things at him, he nevertheless managed to cut the rope. Henceforth the Men were provided with Women.",9,Woman

But Rabbit slept all the time, and the grilled meat was stolen. The next day Parrot stood guard, hidden in a quebracho tree, and he saw the Women, who had toothed vaginas. After remaining quiet and motionless at first, Parrot threw a fruit down from the tree onto the Women who were feasting below. The Women began by accusing each other; then they discovered Parrot and began to fight about whose husband he should be. Women threw things at each other, and one of the sticks went astray and broke the bone under the parrot's tongue. Being now struck dumb and compelled to express himself through gestures, Parrot could not make the Men understand what had happened. It was now Hawk's turn to mount guard, and Hawk took care to arm himself with two throwing sticks. The first missed its target and enabled the Women to discover him; but although Women fought with each other about who should have him as husband and then tried in vain to kill him by throwing things at him, with his second stick Hawk succeeded in cutting one of the two ropes used by the Women to travel up and down from the sky (one rope was for pretty Women with fair complexions, the other for old, ugly ones). Several Women fell down and sank into the earth, but not before Hawk had captured two Women for his own use. Hawk then called to his Men.

But the prea went on gnawing, and the monkey's forecast came true. As he was a very good swimmer, he managed to slip his hand inside the gills of a piranha fish, and he reached the bank alone, waving his catch. Shortly afterward he met the Jaguar who marveled at the sight of the fish and managed to get himself invited to dinner. ""But,"" he asked, ""where is the fire?"" The monkey pointed to the sun which was sinking toward the horizon and bathing the distant landscape in a ruddy glow. ""Yonder,"" he said. ""Can't you see it? Go and fetch it."" The Jaguar went a long way, then came back to say he had not been successful. ""But there it is,"" went on the monkey, ""all flaming red! Run after it, and this time catch up with the fire so that we can cook our fish!"" So off went the Jaguar again. Whereupon the Monkey invented the method of producing fire by rubbing two sticks together, which men were to copy from him later. He kindled a good fire, grilled his fish, and ate it all up, leaving only the bones. After which, he climbed up a tree—some people say it was a jatoba—and settled himself at the top.

He tickled the old woman under the arms to send her to sleep, and when he felt her muscles relax, he seized a burning brand and ran off. But the woman woke up and whistled a signal to her son, the Jaguar, who caught up with the armadillo and took back the firebrand. The agouti, then the tapir, the capuchin monkey, and the howler monkey —in short, all the animals—were equally unfortunate. It was left to that insignificant animal, the prea, to succeed where the others had failed. The prea adopted a different method. When he arrived at the Jaguar's hut, he did not mince his words: ""Good day, grandmother, how are you? I havecome to fetch fire."" Whereupon he seized a burning brand, hung it around his neck, and went off. Having been alerted by his mother's whistle, the Jaguar tried to intercept the prea, but the latter managed to avoid him. The Jaguar went in pursuit, but the prea had several days' lead. The Jaguar eventually caught up with him on the far bank of the Parana. ""Let us talk,"" said the prea to the Jaguar. ""Now that you have lost possession of the fire, you will have to find some other means of subsistence."" Meanwhile the firebrand (what follows suggests that it was more like a log) went on burning, ""thus becoming so much the lighter to carry."" The prea is a trickster. He was so even at that time, and tricked the Jaguar by telling him that there was no healthier food than raw, bloody flesh. ""All right,"" said the Jaguar. ""Let me try it,"" and he hit out with his paw at the prea's muzzle, shortening it to the length at which it has remained. Finally, having been persuaded by the prea that there were other kinds of prey (which means that the prea is responsible for the danger that the Jaguar represents for man), the Jaguar gave him a lesson in cooking: ""If you are in a hurry, light a fire, put the meat on a spit, and grill it; if you have time, cook it in an oven that has been hollowed out in the ground and previously heated; put foliage around the meat to protect it, and earth and hot ashes on top."" While he was giving these explanations, the firebrand finally burned out.

Accompanied by a few Men, Kaboi came to a hole that Kaboi was unable to climb through because Kaboi was very fat; and Kaboi's companions emerged without Kaboi onto the earth's surface, which they started to explore. There were great quantities of fruit, bees, and honey, and they noticed also dead trees and dry wood. Men brought back to Kaboi samples of all they had found. Kaboi examined them and concluded that the earth was a beautiful and fertile place, but that the presence of dead wood proved that everything was doomed to perish. Men would do better to stay where Men were. For in Kaboi's kingdom, Men lived until age made them incapable of moving. A number of Kaboi's ""children"" refused to listen to him, and came to take up their abode on the earth's surface.

Then one of them began digging a well in a hollow, and so much water gushed forth that Asare, however much his brothers urged him to drink, could not exhaust it. The water spread more and more, finally forming the sea. Then Asare recollected that an arrow he particularly prized had been left on the opposite bank. He swam across, found his arrow, and was swimming back when in the middle of the water he found an alligator (jacare), whichhad developed out of a swarm of lizards which Asare had killed while traveling, and which the spreading waters had carried away. Asare begged the alligator to let him sit on him, and when the latter refused, Asare called him names, making fun of his ugly nose. The alligator gave chase. Meanwhile the brothers saw the arrow drifting on the water, concluded that their youngest brother had perished, and marched on. Asare reached land when his pursuer was already close behind. He ran into the woods where the woodpeckers were pecking the bark from the trees in order to eat the insects under it. At his request the birds covered him with strips of bark and sent the alligator off on a false scent. Once the danger was over, Asare went on his way and crossed another river where he met another alligator, with the same consequences.

All the people turned up their noses when he passed, and refused him when he asked permission to rest in their houses. Only the Indian, Wainkaura, made the poor wretch welcome and gave him a new mat on which to sit. He asked his guest whence he came and whither he was bound. Venus explained that he had lost his way. Wainkaura ordered hot water to be brought to him so that he could wash Venus' ulcers and, ignoring his guest's protests, insisted that this should take place inside the hut, and not outdoors. He even ordered his virgin daughter to let Venus sit on her bare thighs, and washed him in this position. Thus the visitor recovered. After nightfall the visitor said to Wainkaura, ""What would you like to have?"" and as Wainkaura did not understand, he explained, ""Do you want to live or to die? Waptokwa is angry over the mutual massacring of the Indians. They have even pierced little children with arrows. So it would be better to destroy all of them at once. But tell no one and quickly pack up your belongings."" He ordered Wainkaura to kill the juruty dove (Leptoptila rufaxilla). When Wainkaura returned with the dove, Venus said that he had deflowered his daughter, and offered to pay compensation. However, Wainkaura refused to accept anything. By means of the dove's carcass, Venus made a large boat in which Wainkaura took his place along with his family. Venus took leave and departed, a whirlwind lifted him up to the sky. At once a distant noise became audible. Then the flood came and carried them all away. Before long, all drowned or died from hunger. Only Wainkaura and his family escaped.",18,God
Kraho - Autxepirire.txt,"An Indian whose wife was unfaithful to him decided to leave her and go far away. He took with him his sons and his daughter who was the youngest of all his children. Hardly had they entered the forest when the men turned into deer in order to advance more rapidly, but the little girl was unable to imitate them. They met the ogre Autxepirire, who was fishing with timbo (a fish poison), and the men turned into diving birds in order to steal his fish from him. Once again the little girl did not succeed in imitating them and went imprudently up to the ogre, who, on seeing her, fell in love with her and asked for her hand in marriage. Since he wished to be as prettily painted as his fiancee, the men told him that he must allow himself to be roasted in the fire. The ogre agreed to this and was burned to death. The little girl noticed that she had left a gourd (a bracelet, in another version) behind near the fire, and she came back to get it. She stirred up the embers and took out a piece of the ogre's penis. The ogre, as it happened, was on the point of rising again from its ashes. The girl ran off, pursued by the monster. Two rivers barred her path. She crossed each one in turn on the back of an alligator, who agreed to play the part of ferryman on condition that the little girl would insult him immediately afterward (sic). In spite of his promises, he ran after her in order to eat her. The heroine took refuge first of all with a rhea (etna), then with wasps who hid her in their nest. She finally rejoined her family, and with some difficulty all eventually escaped from the Autxepirire cannibal spirits, who attacked them in the tree where they had taken refuge. They succeeded in cutting the rope up which their persecutors were climbing. The latter fell to the ground and changed into crabs. Again lost and abandoned, the little girl arrived at a village belonging to the seriemas, the urubus, and the vultures. She hid near a spring, and by spitting on the gourds with which the birds came to draw water, she broke them all- To take their revenge, the birds formed into a flock and forced her to undergo gang rape, sparing neither her eyes, her ears, her nostrils, or the spaces between her toes. . . . Having thus been made ""rotten"" with caresses, the young girl died, and the animals dismembered her body. Each one chose a piece of the vulva and hung it on a perch, to the accompaniment of magic words. At once each piece grew and covered the roof of the hut.

On returning from a particularly successful hunt, he cooked all the game and ate it, except for a female howler monkey, which he put on to smoke overnight. Then he went to bed. On waking up next morning, he resolved to eat the monkey before setting off to hunt, but when he saw the body with the hair all burned off, he experienced a feeling of revulsion, then of anger: ""What is this she-monkey to me? I am hungry and cannot eat it!"" But he left it to smoke, and went off to hunt. In the evening he ate the game he had killed during the day and said, ""Tomorrow I will eat the she-monkey. . . ."" But when the next day came, the same scene occurred; he had only to glance at the she-monkey, and any desire to eat her vanished, so plump and pretty did she seem. After a final glance at the monkey he sighed, ""If only she could change into a wife for me!"" When he returned from hunting, the meal was ready—meat, soup, pancakes . . . and the same was true the next day, when he got back from fishing. The Indian was puzzled and started looking everywhere, until finally he discovered a charming woman lying in his hammock; she told him that she was the she-monkey he had wished for as a wife. After the honeymoon the man brought the woman to the village in order to introduce her to his relatives. Then it was the woman's turn to present her husband to her people—a family of monkeys whose hut was at the top of a tree. The woman helped the man to climb up into it; the next morning she went off with the other monkeys. Neither she nor they ever came back, and the man, who could not climb down unaided, remained marooned at the top of the tree. One morning, the king vulture happened to be passing by. He questioned the man, who told him his story and explained the difficult situation he was in. ""Wait a moment,"" said the vulture as he forced himself to produce a sneeze. From his nose there spurted (nasal) mucus which stretched to the ground and changed into a creeper. However, the creeper was so slender that the man said it might snap under his weight. The vulture thereupon called upon the harpy eagle which also sneezed and whose threads of mucus formed a stronger creeper, down which the hero was able to slide. Before leaving, the harpy eagle told him how to take his revenge. He should cut the liana known as ""the harpy eagle's arrow"" and make it ready in accordance with its instructions and, having duly invoked his protector, go off and hunt the howler monkeys.

Ge - Destructive Fire.txt,"Long before men existed, Sun and Moon lived on the earth. One day, unknown to his brother, Sun set off into the savannah (or steppe) and arrived at the ""foot of the sky"" (Kraho). There he heard the characteristic sound of the woodpeckers piercing the bark of the trees with their beaks. One of the birds had just made a red head ornament of feathers, which gleamed like fire. Sun asked the bird for the headdress, and the latter agreed to give it to him but warned Sun that he would throw it down from the top of the tree; Sun must catch it as it fell and not allow it to touch the ground. The red feather crown came whirling down, nickering so brightly that it looked like real fire. Sun caught it and threw it from one of his hands to the other until it grew cold. Shortly after, Moon discovered the ornament in the hiding place where Sun had put it, and begged his brother to obtain a similar one for him. Somewhat reluctantly Sun led Moon to the woodpeckers, who agreed to supply another ornament. But as Sun was preparing to catch it, Moon insisted on doing so himself, in spite of the warnings uttered by his brother, who feared some disastrous accident. Moon was, as it happened, very clumsy.

But as soon as he caught it, he was carried off into the air; then in a long chain all the others were, too, since each one attempted to hold back the one in front by hanging on to his or her feet. All the people were taken up by the plume; and at last they fell, and all died. Not one of them survived. However, one young woman had remained indoors, because she had been in labor. She gave birth to a series of miraculous children. After telling them of the fate that had befallen their family, she warned them against playing outdoors. But they provoked the sky into sending down the plume again, and succeeded in catching it.

Arecuna - Fish Poison.txt,"Exasperated by her child's crying, a woman left him to the fox. The latter took him home, fed him, and brought him up, but a female tapir stole him. The child grew up completely covered in ticks, which are the tapir's beads. When he became a grown man, the female tapir took him as her husband. She taught him the different meanings that beings and things had for tapirs: the poisonous snake was an oven, but the dog was a poisonous snake. . . . It so happened that the female tapir, who had become pregnant, laid waste the plantation belonging to her husband's parents. Thereupon she urged him to visit his relatives but advised him to keep their marriage secret. The boy was warmly welcomed, but people expressed surprise at the fact that he was covered with ticks. He maintained that this was on account of his losing his way in the forest. The following morning it was discovered that the plantation had been ruined, and the tapir's tracks were noticed. It was decided to kill the tapir. The young man thereupon confessed that she was his wife, and that she was pregnant. They could kill her, provided they were careful not to wound her in the belly, but only under the arm, in the head, or the legs. And he asked his mother to follow the hunters, in order to remove the child from the animal's body as soon as it was dead. As the hero had also foretold, the mother discovered that every time she bathed the child in the river (in secret, following her son's injunctions), quantities of fish died. She therefore washed the child each time there was a shortage of food. But the hero's relatives (sisters' husbands) were curious about the mysterious glut of fish and sent children to spy on their mother-in-law. In this way they discovered the old woman's secret. From then on, the bathing and the collecting of the fish were to take place in public with everyone helping. In this way the fish-eating birds came to know that when the child was washed in the river, there would be a miraculous glut of fish. The tuyuyu bird (Mycteria mycteria, a wood ibis) asked the father to bathe the child for their benefit, and suggested that the operation should take place, not in a stream but in the pool below a waterfall where the fish were more plentiful. The father was frightened and protested, ""You will kill my child!"" But the bird was so insistent that, for the sake of peace, the father, the child, and the whole family went to inspect the pool. There they found the birds, who had arranged to assemble at the spot. The pool was found to be full of fish. The father ordered his son to dive in, but the latter was afraid of the deep and threatening water. The father insisted. Furious, the boy plunged into the water and dived over and over again. Then the father said to him, ""That is enough, my son! There are a lot of dead fish. Come back now!"" But the child was annoyed and refused to listen. The dead fish began to pile up. Finally, the swimmer reached a rock in the middle of the pool and lay there, face downward, without uttering a word. Now he was cold, for when he had dived into the water, he was burning with anger and covered in sweat. And while the men and the birds busied themselves gathering up the fish, he died without speaking. What had happened was that during one of his dives Keyemen—the rainbow in the shape of a huge watersnake—had shot him with an arrow and wounded him. Keyemen was the grandfather of aquatic birds, and the entrance to his subterranean abode was at the bottom of the pool where the fatal fishing expedition was taking place. Full of bitterness, Kulewente (this was the father's name) blamed the birds for his son's death and asked them to avenge it. The birds took turns in trying to dive down to the bottom of the pool, but without success. Then the terrestrial birds and quadrupeds tried, and they too failed. Two remaining birds (two diving birds, Colymbus species) stayed in the background, for they had made no request to the father and bore no responsibility for the boy's death. Nevertheless they agreed to intervene. They dived to the bottom of the pool and killed Keyemen. By means of a liana that they fastened round his neck, the men and the animals succeeded in hauling the monster onto dry land. They skinned the body and cut it into pieces, which they shared out among themselves. According to the nature and color of the portion allotted to each one, the animals acquired the cries, the anatomical peculiarities, the coats, or the plumage that were henceforth to be characteristic of each species. Kulewente put his son's body in a basket and then went off. The grandmother took the basket and walked away with it, singing. Blood oozed from the basket, then pieces of decomposed flesh fell out, creating timbo, from which fish poison is extracted. The bones and sexual organs produced the weak variety, and the rest of the body the strong variety. The grandmother finally turned into an ibis which eats the earthworms men use as bait in fishing. he white egret took its piece and sang, ""a-a,"" a call that it still has to this day. The maguari {Ciconia maguari, a stork) did likewise and uttered its ugly cry: ""a(o)-a(o)."" The soco (Ardea brasiliensis, a heron) placed its piece on its head and wings (where the colored feathers are) and sang, ""koro-koro-koro."" The kingfisher (Alcedo species) put its piece on its head and breast, where the feathers turned red, and sang, ""se-txe-txe-txe."" Then it was the toucan's turn. It covered its breast and belly (where the feathers are white and red). And it said: ""kion-he, he kion-he-he."" A small piece of skin remained stuck to its beak which became yellow. Then came the mutum; it put its piece on its throat and sang, ""hm-hm-hm-hm"" and a tiny remaining strip of skin turned its nostrils yellow. Next came the cujubim (a piping guan), whose piece turned its head, breast, and wings white: it sang, ""krr"" as it has done every morning since. Each bird ""thought its own flute made a pretty sound and kept it."" The richly colored plumage of the macaw is explained by the fact that it seized a large piece of skin and covered its whole body in it; it was imitated in this by the parrots and the yellow parakeets. The oazabaka bird acquired a charming song: ""oazabaka-oazabaka-ku-lu-lu-lu-lu."" And all the birds, including the jacu and the nightingale, received in this way their plumage and their ""flute."" Then came the turn of ground game—the tapir, the capybara, and the deer. Each one chose a piece of skin. The part the deer received as its share sprouted antlers. As a matter of fact, the antlers of the forest species formerly belonged to the savannah species, and vice versa: since the first were bothered by the size of their antlers because they became entangled in creepers and branches, the two species decided to swap. The agouti (Dasyprocta aguti) acquired reddish and white fur on its breast and belly, and its little ""flute"": ""king-king""; the paca {Coelogenys paca) likewise. The tapir was given its warning cry, which was like a whistle. The caititu {Dicotyles torquatus) placed the skin on its shoulders, which accounts for its black hair; and it also received its call ""hx-hx""; while the peccary ( = quiexada : Dicotyles labiatus) said ""rr-rr."" Finally, the great anteater (Myrmecophaga jubata) stretched the skin over its arms and spine where the fur became yellow, and was allotted the cry ""rr-rr"" (clearer than the gutteral and muted ""rr-rr"" of the peccary). Each species of monkey was also given a cry, and in this way all the wild animals obtained their colored coats and their ""flutes.""",16,FishPoison

Tawkxwax went up to her and asked for a drink. The old woman pointed to the jars and told him to drink as much as he wished. But Tawkxwax made the water very warm and asked the old woman to go and get fresh water from the river. Since she was anxious about her granddaughter, whom she was nursing, Tawkxwax advised her to put her into the hammock. He then murmured magic words, so that the old woman's jar would not fill up before he had had time to finish eating the child. When she reached the river, the old woman tried in vain to draw the water. Meanwhile, Tawkxwax took the child, grilled her, and ate her, then put a stone in her place (Toba version: Fox put his mouth to the baby's anus and sucked out all its substance; only the skin was left). He then lifted the spell, the jar filled with water, and the old woman returned. When she saw the stone, she wept and became angry.

She put the trickster into a deep sleep, and while he slept, she blocked all the orifices of his body—mouth, nostrils, eyes, armpits, penis, and anus—with wax; and she also smeared over the spaces between his fingers and toes. When the demiurge awoke, he realized that he was swelling up in a dangerous manner.

One day, she flew down to the water to seize a terrapin which was surfacing; but the terrapin was too heavy; it dragged the bird down to the bottom, and the eagle was drowned. By its cries the motherless eagle attracted the attention of a black eagle which at first took care of it, but soon wearied of the task and flew away. A ""rapina"" eagle took its place, and when the eaglet grew up, its two protectors trained it to lift heavier and heavier tree trunks so that it would be able to get even with the terrapin and avenge its mother's death. When it was ready, it lay in wait for the terrapin. The terrapin came up to the surface, its whole body decked out in the dead eagle's feathers, and provoked the young one. The bird dived and seized the terrapin which tried to pull it into the water, but the other terrapins pushed their fellow terrapin back to the surface. The bird flew off to the nest with its prey. The eagle invited all the birds to eat the terrapin, whose shell had first to be broken. The toucan had a try, and its beak became flattened, whence its present shape; the woodpecker succeeded. Then the birds painted themselves with the red blood, the blue fluid from the gallbladder, and the yellow fat. The toucan smeared blue all around its eyes, and yellow on the end of its tail, and a band of yellow across its breast. It also put a daub of blood on its tail. The woodpecker painted its head red; the pipira (a tanager) daubed itself all over with blue.
